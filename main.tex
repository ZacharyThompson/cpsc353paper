\maketitle

\section{Executive Summary}
Passwordless authentication describes a collection of authentication methods which do not rely on the user remembering and entering a password in order to be authenticated.
Proponents of passwordless authentication argue it is both more convenient and more secure than traditional, password-based authentication.

This paper will look at the flaws of password based authentication and analyze whether passwordless authentication can address them.
It will describe the various methods of passwordless authentication and discuss at their benefits and drawbacks.
