# Passwordless authentication

## Security Issues with Password
* Good Passwords are Hard to Memorize
* Passwords are often reused
* If attacker has email control, passwords can often be reset

## How does it work
### What is FIDO2?
* Open authentication standard that websites can use to implement passwordless authentication.
### Types of passwordless authentication
* Token generator
* Biometrics

## Is it safer? (Less prone/resistant to attack)

## Account recovery
* Whats the best account recovery method
